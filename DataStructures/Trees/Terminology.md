4. **Parent**: Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

5. **Child**: The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

7. **Subtree**: Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

8. **Visiting**: Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

9. **Traversing**: Passing through nodes in a specific order is called traversing.

10. **Levels**: Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
